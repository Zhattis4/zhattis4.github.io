Hi, my name is Zev Hattis and this is my autobiography.  I don't like writing very much, that is why I became an engineer, so I don't have to take any more writing classes.  However, it is an important skill so I guess this is a good time to practice.  I am currently writing this while eating a turkey and cheese sandwich - it is very good.  Quick fact: I have no idea what FERPA stands for.  You may be thinking "why don't you just google it."  Well, I am actually writing this using a type writer that has connection to sublime text, but not the Internet so that is why.  Regardless, I like that FERPA allows me to make this up because I can ramble about ridiculous things like this.  Have a great day!
